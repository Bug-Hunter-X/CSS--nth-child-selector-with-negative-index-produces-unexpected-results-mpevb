The solution involves avoiding negative indices within the `:nth-child` selector.  Instead of using a formula that could produce negative values, use a positive index or a different selector that achieves the same result.

```css
ul li:nth-child(-n+3) { /* Buggy code */
  color: blue;
}

ul li:nth-child(n) { /* Solution: style all list items*/
  color: blue;
}
ul li:nth-child(n+4) { /* Solution: remove style from 4th onwards*/
  color: black;
}
```

This revised code will consistently style the first three list items (or all if intended) across different browsers.
